<h2><b> Presto </h2> </b>

<h2><b> Description:</b></h2> Presto is an application that is made for inventory management. A more intuitive (and less maddening) way for businesses & people to keep track of their assets.  Our intuitive interface means you'll be up and running in minutes, using features geared specifically to your asset management needs. We support team collaboration around asset reservations, maintenance, checkouts, and audits, with Barcode and QR Code scans via our mobile app. We also support RFID tag scans on external scanners. We're the complete asset tracking system - from procurement to retirement.

<h2><b> Installation instructions: </b></h2> Upon downloading the application, you will be asked to authenticate through Google. Users must have a Gmail account to proceed through the application. Once the authentication process is successful, the user is taken to the GUI and asked to select the "In" or "Out" control. The "In" Control is for inventory that is "in" storage or being received by a vender. The "Out" control is designed to assign the asset to an employee by the inventory number. Once the user selects "In" they are taken to a screen to enter the inventory ID, Inventory Type. When the user selects "Out" they are brought to a screen to enter an Employee ID, Employee Department, Inventory ID, and Quanity. The user is allowed to add, edit, and delete on each control. 

<h2><b> Website usage:</b></h2>The website is designed to be the marketing for Presto Pro (for Businesses) and is used as an informative website. The user can find more information about the app, as well as, read about testimonial's from current users.
